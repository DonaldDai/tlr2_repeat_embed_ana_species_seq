## Online Usage Guide

1. **Access the Page**: Click the link above to enter the online viewer.
2. **Select Data**: In the control panel on the top right, select the two proteins you want to compare (Protein 1 and Protein 2) and the desired layer (Layer).
3. **Adjust Threshold**: Drag the "Similarity Threshold" slider to filter out low-similarity noise and make high-similarity regions clearer.
4. **Select Region**: Click on a highlighted diagonal region of interest on the heatmap to lock the selection.
5. **View 3D Structure**:
   - After selecting a region, **right-click** your mouse.
   - Select **"Show 3D Structure"** from the pop-up menu.
   - Two 3D structure windows will appear. The protein structures will synchronously highlight the sequence fragment you selected in the heatmap (in red) and the corresponding specific clicked point (in orange).
   - You can rotate and zoom one model, and the other model will automatically synchronize its view.
